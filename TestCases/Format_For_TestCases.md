# Format of Test Cases

## Input format
-  The first line contains one integer ***n*** - the number of equations of lines.
- Each of the next ***n*** lines contain two integers ***m*** and ***c*** separated by a single space- the slope of the line and the y-intercept.
- It represents the equation of the form y = m*x + c.
- Ensure that the assumptions given in the problem statement are satisfied. They are as follows:
    -  ***m*** is not equal to 0, âˆž. 
    - No two ***m***'s are equal.
    - There are exactly n*(n-1)/2 intersection points.
    
## Output format
- The first line will contain a single integer k - the number of intersection points that lie on the right side of the y-axis.
